## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Objectives

This project aims to go beyond the classic limitations of real estate prediction models by offering an intelligent and forward-looking solution capable of **anticipating the evolution of real estate prices in Paris over the next 10 years**.  
The objectives are as follows:

- **Predict future prices** of real estate in the short and medium term (up to 2035), integrating not only current data but also **upcoming development projects**, **public policies**, and **planned urban investments**.
- Lever **open data** and **information extracted from government sites** (PLU, construction projects, urban renovations, etc.) using **web scraping** techniques to enrich the knowledge base.
- Consider **future influencing factors** (new transport lines, school construction, commercial areas, parks, etc.) to model territorial dynamics with potential impact on property values.
- Provide a predictive and interactive decision-making tool for investors, urban planners, citizens, and public actors.

### 1.2 General Description

Unlike classic real estate prediction projects that rely solely on past and present trends, this solution proposes an innovative approach focused on the **future of the Parisian territory**.

The project architecture rests on three pillars:

- **A Django backend platform** that manages prediction logic, exposes REST API endpoints, and orchestrates all data flows between components.
- **A React frontend interface**, intuitive, responsive and mobile-first (Figma-inspired design), allowing users to simulate price evolution in different urban contexts.
- **An advanced modeling engine** based on robust algorithms like **CatBoost**, **LightGBM** and **RandomForest**, enriched by advanced **feature engineering** incorporating **future urbanization indicators** extracted from open sources.

The project also includes an **intelligent interactive map** that displays geolocated predictions and highlights areas with high evolution potential. Through **dynamic scenario planning**, users can explore the effects of future developments on price per m¬≤, thus anticipating investment opportunities.

By combining **open data, artificial intelligence and urban strategy**, this project aims to become a reference in prospective real estate forecasting.

## 3. Dataset Construction

A custom dataset was built from open data and web scraping to predict real estate prices in Paris, taking into account the urban environment (green spaces, public facilities, monuments).

## 3.1 Data Sources

The following sources were used to collect the necessary data for building the dataset:

1. *Real Estate Data (DVF)*  
   - *Source:* [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/)  
   - *Description:* Public dataset on property values in Paris.

2. *Parisian Facilities*  
   - *Source:* [INSEE - BPE Database](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/8217525?sommaire=8217537&q=bpe)  
   - *Description:* Geolocated information on Parisian facilities such as shops, services, sports and health infrastructures.

3. *Green Spaces*  
   - *Source:* [Open Data Paris - Green Spaces](https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/espaces_verts/table/?disjunctive.type_ev&disjunctive.categorie&disjunctive.adresse_codepostal&disjunctive.presence_cloture)  
   - *Description:* Data on green spaces that can influence property prices based on proximity.

4. *Parisian Monuments*  
   - *Source:* [Paris J'aime - Monuments](https://parisjetaime.com/article/les-monuments-parisiens-un-patrimoine-exceptionnel-a024)  
   - *Description:* Web scraping extraction of data on historical monuments in Paris, important elements for heritage impact.

## 3.2 Web Scraping

To enrich our dataset with specific information not directly available as open data, a web scraping process was implemented to collect data on Parisian monuments. This data allowed for the integration of additional variables on the city's architectural heritage, a factor potentially influencing real estate prices in nearby areas.

## 3.3 Merging and Preprocessing

Once the different data sources were collected and cleaned, a merging process was performed to assemble this information into a single structured dataset:

- *Cleaning DVF Data:* Removal of missing values and errors.
- *Merging Environmental Data:* Association of geolocated data of facilities, green spaces and monuments with real estate data based on geographical proximity.
- *Variable Preprocessing:* Formatting dates, geolocation of properties and facilities, and transformation of data into a format suitable for analysis.

## 3.4 Feature Engineering

In this step, we created new variables from existing data to enrich our predictive model:

- *Creation of Environmental Indices:* For example, indices to characterize the density of green spaces, proximity to monuments or key facilities such as shops and health services.
- *Exploitation of Temporal Variables:* Use of temporal information related to property transaction dates to extract trends and price fluctuation periods.
- *Aggregations:* Calculation of mean, median and variance for different geographical areas (neighborhoods, districts) based on facilities and environment.

These new variables created allowed us to enrich the prediction model and improve the performance of the machine learning model.

# 4. Predictive Modeling

After building the enriched dataset, we applied machine learning models to predict real estate prices in Paris. This section presents model selection, training, validation and performance evaluation.

## 4.1 Model Selection

Three regression models were selected for this task:
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Model based on aggregation of multiple decision trees.
- **CatBoost Regressor**: Gradient boosting model optimized for categorical data.
- **LightGBM Regressor**: Fast and efficient boosting model for large amounts of data.

These models were evaluated on versions with and without feature engineering to compare their performance.

## 4.2 Training and Validation

Models were trained on 80% of the data for training and 20% for evaluation. Training included data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation, and validation on a subset to measure real-time performance.

## 4.3 Performance Evaluation

Model performance was measured on the test set using the following metrics:
- **R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination)**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

### Model Results:

- **Without Feature Engineering**: The **LGBM** model on encoded data showed the best results with **R¬≤ of 0.6369**. However, absolute and squared errors were relatively high, suggesting room for improvement.

- **With Feature Engineering**: By enriching the dataset with indices (commercial, educational, health, etc.), performance significantly improved. The **RandomForest** model achieved **R¬≤ of 0.9276**, with the lowest **MSE** and **MAE**, outperforming **CatBoost** (R¬≤ of 0.9208) and **LightGBM**.

### Final Model Selection:

At the end of this analysis, **the RandomForest model with feature engineering is selected** as the best choice for predicting real estate prices. This model showed the best explanatory capacity and the lowest errors.

Here is the complete architecture of the machine learning part, integrating **data collection**, **feature engineering** and **modeling** with the selected RandomForest model:

# 5. Backend ‚Äì Django API

The backend API is developed with Django REST Framework to manage communication between the frontend and the machine learning model.

## 5.1 API Architecture
The API relies on Django to create RESTful endpoints that process requests, execute predictions, and return results to the frontend. It includes a data model for storing information and a module for managing predictions via the ML model.

## 5.2 Key Endpoints
- **POST /predict/**: Receives real estate data, makes a prediction and returns the predicted price.
- **GET /health/**: Checks that the API is functioning properly.
- **GET /model-info/**: Provides information about the prediction model used.

## 5.3 Frontend Communication
The frontend (React) communicates with the Django API via HTTP requests sent with Axios. Data is sent in JSON format and the response contains the predicted real estate price.

<div align="right">

[‚¨Ü Back to top](#top)

</div>

## 6. Frontend ‚Äì React Application

The frontend is developed in React, based on an initial Figma mockup designed for mobile. The interface was then adapted for wider screens, but without strictly following a mobile-first approach.

### 6.1 User Interface
The application offers a simple and intuitive interface allowing users to:
- Enter property characteristics (area, location, type, etc.).
- Launch price prediction.
- View the estimated price in real time.

### 6.2 API Connection
The frontend uses Axios to communicate with the Django API. When the form is submitted, data is sent via a POST request, and the predicted price is displayed to the user.

### 6.3 Responsive Design
Although the initial mockup was designed for mobile, the implementation focused on a responsive design, manually adapted to different screen sizes. React components are organized modularly to ensure maintainability and reusability.

### 6.4 Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the user interface:
